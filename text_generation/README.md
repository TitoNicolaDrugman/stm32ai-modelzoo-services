# Text Generation STM32 Model Zoo

This folder provides a **reference implementation and tooling to train, quantize, evaluate, benchmark and deploy compact text generation (language modeling) networks on STM32 devices** (MCU / MPU) using the STM32Cube.AI toolchain.

> Focus: lightweight Transformer‐style (e.g. *tiny BERT generator*) word level language models suitable for on‑device next‑token generation.

## Core Concepts

The workflow is orchestrated by `stm32ai_main.py` using an `operation_mode` value from the YAML configuration. Modes encapsulate single services (training, quantization, evaluation, prediction, benchmarking, deployment) or *chains* that sequence them.

**Typical metrics:** loss (cross‑entropy), accuracy (if framed as next‑token classification), validation loss, and derived perplexity (can be computed as `exp(loss)`).

## Operation Modes

In chain names: **t** = training, **q** = quantization, **e** = evaluation, **b** = benchmarking, **d** = deployment.

| `operation_mode` | Operations (in order)                                                                    | Notes                                                   |

## Model Types

Initial reference model: **`tiny_bert_generator`** (compact Transformer encoder producing next‑token logits). Additional model variants can be added under `src/models/` – ensure each exposes a factory function and is referenced in configuration.

*Add more lightweight architectures (e.g. distilled transformer, GRU / LSTM baselines) for comparative benchmarking.*

---

## Datasets & Tokenization

Place raw corpus files (plain text, UTF‑8) inside `datasets/`. Use `combine_corpus.py` to merge or preprocess multiple sources into `full_corpus.txt`.

Tokenization strategy (example): simple whitespace / word index (see `tokenizer.json`). You may substitute a character‑level or subword tokenizer; update preprocessing + config accordingly.

**Representative data for quantization**: by default pulled from the training corpus unless a dedicated quantization path is specified.

---

## Configuration Files

All tunable settings reside in YAML (Hydra/OmegaConf). Main sections typically include:

* `general`: run naming, model path, output directory.
* `dataset`: paths, sequence length, vocabulary specs, batch sizes.
* `model`: architecture hyperparameters (embedding dim, heads, layers, FFN size, etc.).
* `training`: epochs, optimizer params, learning rate schedule, early stopping.
* `quantization`: representative dataset size, calibration parameters.
* `prediction`: prompt, max tokens, decoding temperature / top‑k (if available).
* `deployment` & `benchmarking`: board type, clock config, runtime profiling options.
* `tools.stm32ai`: on‑cloud / local settings, version.

Override any parameter from the CLI (Hydra pattern): `section.param=value`.

## Typical Workflows

**1. Train & Evaluate**

```
operation_mode=training
```

Inspect metrics (TensorBoard) in `src/experiments_outputs/<run>/logs`.

**2. Quantize & Compare**

```
operation_mode=chain_eqe model.float_model_path=<path_to_h5>
```

Check metric deltas (accuracy / loss / perplexity) pre vs post quantization.

**3. Benchmark On Device**

```
operation_mode=chain_qb deployment.hardware_setup.board=STM32H7
```

Review latency / memory usage reported by benchmarking scripts.

**4. Deploy**

```
operation_mode=chain_qd deployment.hardware_setup.board=STM32N6570-DK
```

Generated C sources land under `deployment/c_project/Middlewares/ST/AI/`.

**5. Generate Text**

```
operation_mode=prediction prediction.prompt="STM32 embedded AI" prediction.max_tokens=50
```

Retrieve generated sequence from console / saved logs.

---

## Benchmarking & MLflow

Each run logs parameters + metrics to `mlruns/` (MLflow). TensorBoard events stored in `.../logs/`. Use these to compare architectures or quantization impacts across runs.

---

## Deployment

Deployment scripts integrate with STM32Cube.AI (local or Developer Cloud if `tools.stm32ai.on_cloud=true`). After `chain_qd`, follow board README instructions to flash and (if needed) toggle boot switches (e.g. STM32N6570-DK notice).

Generated headers (`model.h`, `tokenizer.h`, `embedding.h`) are prepared for inclusion in application firmware.

---

## Extending the Zoo

1. Add new model file under `src/models/`.
2. Expose a build function returning a compiled `tf.keras.Model`.
3. Register / reference it in configuration (`model.name` or similar parameter).
4. Provide a minimal config example for training & quantization.
5. (Optional) Supply a pre‑trained & quantized artifact in `pretrained_models/`.

## Getting Help

Check individual READMEs inside subfolders for mode‑specific guidance (training, quantization, evaluation, deployment). For quick orientation, start with a small corpus + reduced model dimensions, then scale once the pipeline works end‑to‑end.

Happy generating on STM32! 🚀
